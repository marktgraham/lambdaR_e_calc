# lambdaR_e_calc

There are two functions provided:

lambdaR_e_calc: A function that calculates lambdaR_e from 2D stellar kinematic data. The beam correction is automatically performed "in house" provided the dispersion of the point source function (PSF) and the Sersic index are given. 

lambdaR_e_correct: A function that calculates the beam-corrected values from observed values of lambdaR_e. This function is useful for correcting a catalogue of values as arrays can be given.
